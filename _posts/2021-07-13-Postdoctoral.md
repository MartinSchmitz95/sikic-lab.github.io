<h2>Project 1</h2>
<body>
Job Title: Postdoctoral fellow<br />
Grant end date :  31/07/2024<br />
Contract Period : 01/08/2021 â€“ 31/07/2024 (3 years)<br /><br />

The   project   aims   to   develop   the   AI   method   to   detect   present   microbes   in   asample   (ie.   throat-swab,   urine,   blood)   sequenced   using nanopore   technology.Nanopore sequencers read DNA/RNA fragments while they are passing through atiny pore. Passage of nucleotides through pore results in a signal which is in a downstream process converted to the sequence of nucleotides.<br /><br />
The project will start with recognising each microbe using a pattern matchingapproach, like those for rapid song recognition. These methods will be performedon either raw signal or basecalled sequence of nucleotides. We aim to use deeplearning   methods   to   find   a   concise   representation   of   each   known   microbegenome.<br /><br />
The fast and accurate detection of microbes that cause infections disease canreduce unnecessary usage of antibiotics, speed up recovery and sometimes evensave lives. When clinicians do not have a clue about the possible pathogen, thecurrent methods can last days to identify the pathogen correctly.<br /><br />
In this role, one will be part of a multi-disciplinary team consisting of computer scientists, biologists, and bioinformaticians. Duties include developing algorithmsand AI methods for the fast identification of present microbes.<br />
