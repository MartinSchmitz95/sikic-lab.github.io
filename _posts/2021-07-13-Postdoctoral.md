<h2>Project 1</h2>

Job Title: Postdoctoral fellow<br />
Grant end date :  31/07/2024<br />
Contract Period : 01/08/2021 â€“ 31/07/2024 (3 years)<br /><br />

The   project   aims   to   develop   the   AI   method   to   detect   present   microbes   in   asample   (ie.   throat-swab,   urine,   blood)   sequenced   using   nanopore   technology.Nanopore sequencers read DNA/RNA fragments while they are passing through atiny pore. Passage of nucleotides through pore results in a signal which is in a downstream process converted to the sequence of nucleotides.<br /><br />
The project will start with recognising each microbe using a pattern matchingapproach, like those for rapid song recognition. These methods will be performedon either raw signal or basecalled sequence of nucleotides. We aim to use deeplearning   methods   to   find   a   concise   representation   of   each   known   microbegenome.<br /><br />
The fast and accurate detection of microbes that cause infections disease canreduce unnecessary usage of antibiotics, speed up recovery and sometimes evensave lives. When clinicians do not have a clue about the possible pathogen, thecurrent methods can last days to identify the pathogen correctly.<br /><br />
In this role, one will be part of a multi-disciplinary team consisting of computer scientists, biologists, and bioinformaticians. Duties include developing algorithmsand AI methods for the fast identification of present microbes.<br /><br />

Requirements:<br />
- Phd in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, or a related discipline.<br />
- Strong programming skills (ie. C++, Rust, Python)<br />
- Active knowledge of PyTorch, Tensorflow or similar deep learning frameworks<br />
- Excellent communication skills in written and spoken English<br /><br />

  <h2>Project 1: AI methods for improving DNA sequencing</h2>
Genome sequencing assembling is one of the most essential tasks in genomics. High accuracy sequences help us find relevant information about the sequenced organism (i.e., human or virus) which is especially important for clinical use. 
This project will focus on one, important sub-task of genome sequencing, named basecalling. As the DNA strand passes through the nanopore, a few nucleobases create a characteristic current disruption in the pore. A sequencing device continuously measures electrical current and stores it for sequence decoding. The process of sequence decoding from the measured current is called basecalling.<br /><br />
  
The focus of this project will be on developing high accuracy basecaller using deep learning methods. The student will get to know the practical approaches to data preparation and deep learning (such as attention networks and transformers). The solution will be implemented using Python and PyTorch library. The student will be encouraged to publish his application on GitHub as an open-source project.<br /><br />
