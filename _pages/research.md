  title: "Algorithms and Data Structures in Genomics"
  excerpt: "We aim to develop fast and memory-efficient tools for the analysis of DNA and RNA sequencing data. We have developed several state-of-the-art tools for sequence alignment (Edlib), mapping long reads (Graphmap and Graphmap2) and single and metagenome de novo genome assembly (Racon, Raven and RA) and classification of microbes from a metagenomics sample. In our work, we use classical algorithms and data structures for work with strings and graphs. In our work, we prefer using C++, which enables various levels of optimization. We use SIMD instruction (SPOA), MPI and CUDA GPU (SW#) parallelization."
